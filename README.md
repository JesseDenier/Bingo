# Bingo

A fun interactive bingo sheet that saves status of each card to localStorage. Can easily be adapted and changed for different events. This one is for Natalie Beckers bar crawl.

## Description

Using Bootstrap CSS and some localStorage and toggle jQuery functions I created a 5 by 5 grid of togglable cards with tasks on them. Here is a screenshot of my completed work as of 2.2.2024.
